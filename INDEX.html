    <p>Foodies are a distinct hobbyist group.
        Typical foodie interests and activities include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling, 
        food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, food distribution, food fads, health 
        and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary tourism, and restaurant management. A foodie might develop a particular interest in 
        a specific item, such as the best egg cream or burrito. Many publications have food columns that cater to foodies and many of 
        the websites carrying the name foodie have become popular amongst the foodies.[6] Interest by foodies in the 1980s and 1990s 
        gave rise to the Food Network and other specialized food programming, popular films and television shows about food such as 
        Top Chef and Iron Chef, a renaissance in specialized cookbooks, specialized periodicals such as Gourmet Magazine and Cook's 
        Illustrated, growing popularity of farmers' markets,[7] food-oriented websites like Zagat's and Yelp, publishing and reading
         food blogs like Foodbeast and foodieworld, specialized kitchenware stores like Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table, and the 
         institution of the celebrity chef.</p>
